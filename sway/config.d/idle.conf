### Idle configuration
#
# Example configuration:
#
 exec swayidle -w \
          timeout 600 'swaylock -f -c 00011f' \
          timeout 1000 'swaymsg "output * dpms off"' resume 'swaymsg "output * dpms on"' \
          before-sleep 'swaylock -f -c 010101'
#
# This will lock your screen after 300 seconds of inactivity, then turn off
# your displays after another 300 seconds, and turn your screens back on when
# resumed. It will also lock your screen before your computer goes to sleep.
